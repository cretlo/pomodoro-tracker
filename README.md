# Pomodoro Tracker

### Description

`pomodoro-tracker` is a pomodoro technique based application that tracks your task and break sessions to provide you with analytics so that you can gain better insight and make better decisions about your work, study, or general task habits.

### Why?

Routinely using the pomodoro technique and various apps that implement the technique, I found that in order to receive useful features -- such as tracking and analytics -- I had to pay monthly subscriptons, or I found the analytics provided to be lacking. This drove me to implement my own that anyone can use.
